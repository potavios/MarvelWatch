# Marvel Watch
Project to practice Android RecyclerView.

This app shows us the right order to watch the movies of Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
You can filter by release date or chronologycal date (the order that the facts happen).

In this project I implemented:
- RecyclerView
- Youtube API (to get the movies trailers)
- Intents

The content of this app (images, text descriptions, etc, were got from Marvel's website:
